We currently are not using Asciidoc for the deployment guide, instead editing through a web UI.  As a result, this deployment guide is not currently being maintained.  You can view the current deployment guide [here](https://academy.datastax.com/demos/deployment-guide-azure).

This is the DataStax Enterprise Deployment Guide for Azure.  This guide is written in [Asciidoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) and is built with [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org).

To build it, run ./gradlew asciidoctor from the top level directory of this project.  You can view the output file build/asciidoc/DataStax-Enterprise-Deployment-Guide-for-Azure.html in a web-browser.
